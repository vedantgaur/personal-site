👋 Hello!

I'm a Sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a dual degree in CS and Business through the [Jerome Fisher Management & Technology (M&T)](https://fisher.wharton.upenn.edu/) program. 🎓

This unique program allows me to combine my passion for technology with my interest in entrepreneurship and business strategy.
Before starting at Penn, I was based in the Bay Area 🌉, where I developed a strong foundation and passion for deep learning and natural language processing. During this time, I actively engaged in various projects that merged my interests in artificial intelligence and practical problem-solving. You can find some of my projects on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/vedantgaur/). 

🔍 My research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. I've already begun exploring these areas, having worked on interpretability, reasoning, and evaluation. This work has been recognized in academic circles, with publications in ACL and presentations at IEEE conferences. You can view some of my papers in the [Publications](/publications/) section.

Outside of academics, I'm passionate about applying technology to create positive social impact. I've used my experience in deep learning to develop tools to increase access to [speech impediment diagnosis](/portfolio/).

When I'm not immersed in coursework or research, you can find me engaging in various activities. I enjoy swimming and rock climbing, traveling to experience new cultures, reading philosophy, and staying updated on the latest developments in the tech industry. 

I'm also multilingual, with proficiency in English, Hindi, and Spanish, which I believe is crucial in our increasingly globalized world.
As I continue my journey at Penn, I'm excited to further explore the possibilities at the intersection of technology and business, and to contribute to groundbreaking research in artificial intelligence. 🚀
